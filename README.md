The Mauna Loa CO_2 Concentration

In this project the time series data given for analyzing and forecasting co_2 concentration given by Institution of Oceanography recorded over 60 years. 

## INtroduction:
In 1958, Charles David Keeling (1928-2005) from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography began recording carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere at an observatory located at about 3,400 m altitude on the Mauna Loa Volcano on Hawaii Island. The location was chosen because it is not influenced by changing CO2 levels due to the local vegetation and because prevailing wind patterns on this tropical island tend to bring well-mixed air to the site. While the recordings are made near a volcano (which tends to produce CO2), wind patterns tend to blow the volcanic CO2 away from the recording site. Air samples are taken several times a day, and concentrations have been observed using the same measuring method for over 60 years. In addition, samples are stored in flasks and periodically reanalyzed for calibration purposes. The observational study is now run by Ralph Keeling, Charles's son. The result is a data set with very few interruptions and very few inhomogeneities. It has been called the â€œmost important data set in modern climate research."
